  return "I'll use some strategies to do this task in a given time by : \n Task Prioritization: Identify which task is more urgent. And Start from the higher-priority task first and assess the second task within the rest of the hours. \n Separate the Tasks into Parts: If possible, break each task into smaller components. Work on one part of each task within the 3-hour window. This way, you make some progress on both tasks. \n Seek Extensions or Assistance: If the tasks are work-related, see if you can get an extension or delegate part of the tasks to someone else. \n Adjust my Approach: Consider if any parts of the tasks can be simplified to fit within the available time.";
